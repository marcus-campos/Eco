                            Understanding traits of individual organisms helps explain patterns and processes at
                            other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several
                            areas of <b>ecology</b> of evolution that focus on such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology,
                            metabolic theory of <b>ecology</b>, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an
                            organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction.
                            Other traits may be related to structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of
                            a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits
                            include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the
                            surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs.
                            drought deciduous trees and shrubs.
                            One set of characteristics relate to body size and temperature. The metabolic theory of <b>ecology</b>
                            provides a predictive qualitative set of relationships between an organism’s body size and
                            temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic
                            rates and this results in a variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates,
                            reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.
                            The traits of organisms are subject to change through acclimation, development, and evolution.
                            For this reason, individuals form a shared focus for ecology and for evolutionary <b>ecology.</b>

                        Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on individual,
                        organizational or governmental levels,for the benefit of both the environment and humans.
                        Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population and technology,the biophysical environment
                        is being degraded,sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have
                        begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s,
                        activity of environmental movements has created awareness of the various environmental issues.
                        There is no agreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity and even
                        scientific dishonesty occurs, so protection measures are occasionally debated.
