                            The scope of <b>ecology</b> contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning
                            micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems,
                            for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms
                            that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities).
                            Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are
                            always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years
                            for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An
                            ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence
                            to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in
                            and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a
                            single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The
                            nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details
                            of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted
                            until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.Some ecological principles, however,
                            do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the
                            whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a
                            designated time frame.

                        <b>Biodiversity</b> (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from
                        genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several
                        interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its
                        complex organization.<b>Biodiversity</b> includes species diversity, ecosystem diversity,
                        and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the
                        complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels.<b>Biodiversity</b>
                        plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality
                        of life.Preventing species extinctions is one way to preserve biodiversity and that goal
                        rests on techniques that preserve genetic diversity, habitat and the ability for species to migrate.
                        [citation needed] Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and
                        considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. Natural capital that supports
                        populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration
                        (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which
                        those service losses are experienced.An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications
                        for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to
                        consulting firms, governments, and industry.
